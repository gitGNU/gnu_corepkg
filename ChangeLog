2012.06.14 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Update core.info file to point to Savannah as SRC_URL.

2012.06.08 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Redirect error to STDERR and exit in BUILD script.
* Simplify /tmp/sGOS-$PKG prep logic.
* Move chmod operation outside root user block, i.e. make sure as much
  of the script as possible runs as an unprivileged user.

2012.06.07 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Make sure directories in BUILD script have x-bit (i.e. compensate
  for varying umask)

2012.05.27 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

2012.05.27 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Clean up build directory when run unpriveleged.

2012.05.9 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Grammatical correction.

2012.03.24 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Update BUILD script to be a better example.
* Update for 1.3.1.

* Be POSIX compliant.

2012.03.13 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Remove CONTENTS print from package query.

  -q file listing is a botch. It's better not to risk using this
  for something important by mistake.

2012.03.13 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Fix a bug with the upgrade and remove functions that broke
  the trailing dir argument.
* This is now corepkg-1.2.1.

2011.12.2 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Add the core.info file from the sGOS corepkg-1.2 cpk file.

2011.09.25 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Improve create_pkg scalability, by using find, instead of touch,
  as the initial command.
* In install_pkg, a message should only be returned if the package is
  already installed.  This is an oversight from the 09.12 change.
* Remove packages safely.  If a file is shared by two or more packages,
  do not remove that file.  Add a log of the package and files removed. 
* Allow files and directories to be removed to have spaces.  This fixes
  an outstanding bug in Devan's original corepkg.

2011.09.13 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Add -u to corepkg.  This allows packages to be upgraded
  in place.  No more boot-to-rescue nonsense.

2011.09.12 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Errors should be sent to STDERR, not STDOUT.

2011.09.10 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Don't rely on GNU tar specific options.

2011.06.28 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Add GPLv2+ copyright notices.  Specifically, Josh Devan wanted
  both the corepkg script and the man page to be under any GPL version
  2 or better as preferred by the user, e.g. v2, v2+, v3, v3+. I felt that
  GPLv2+ fit that bill best.

2011.01.12 D. E. Evans <sinuhe@gnu.org>

* Use /bin/bash, not /bin/sh.
* Modify sed syntax for use with non-GNU sed.
* Rebrand as sGOS.
* Correct usage summary and follow more typical Unix man page style.
  This includes similar improvements to the manual.
* Make case statement more readable.
* Use more instead of less. This avoids the user having to interact when
  installing a package. This is especially useful when automating installs.
* Rewrite the manual to more correctly reflect the syntax and to improve
  readability.
